# A stackfull C++ coroutine supports `yield()` & `resume()`

- The frt library plans to provide a smart C++ string implementation (frt::FRTString) with 3 data storage strategies (similar to FBString).
- A coroutine frame is need to help string searching algorithms generate results asynchronously (a pattern string may match the text string at multiple positions).
