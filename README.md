## A stackfull C++ coroutine supports `yield()` & `resume()` 

* The frt library plans to provide a smart C++ string implementation (frt:: FRTString) with 3 data storage strategies (similar to FBString).
* A coroutine frame is need to help string searching algorithms generate results asynchronously (a pattern string may match the text string at multiple positions).
